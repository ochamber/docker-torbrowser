# This file creates a container that runs X11 and SSH services
# The ssh is used to forward X11 and provide you encrypted data
# communication between the docker container and your local 
# machine.
#
# Xpra allows to display the programs running inside of the
# container such as Firefox, LibreOffice, xterm, etc. 
# with disconnection and reconnection capabilities
#
# The applications are rootless, therefore the client machine 
# manages the windows displayed.
# 
# ROX-Filer creates a very minimalist way to manage 
# files and icons on the desktop.
